# Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models

This repository serves as the central hub for the bachelor thesis focused on Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models.

Here you will find:

* **Data:** All relevant datasets generated and used during the research, including outputs from language models and their annotations.
* **Scripts:** The programs and scripts utilized for data generation, processing, analysis, and visualization of results.

The thesis aims to analyze whether large language models assign lower probabilities to output tokens when they are hallucinating, and potentially to develop a model to detect such hallucinations based on these findings.
