    #             Color of clothing (red shirt)
    #             Age (12 years old)  
    #             Carried object (blue backpack)
    #             Pet (black dog)

    #         - Mention the detail just once naturally

    #         2. Set in normal places like school/park/store or anything else.

    #         3. Question Format:
    #         - Create ONE ambiguous question about either character's trait using:
    #         "What color..." / "How old..." / "What name... "


    #         4. Output Format:
    #         [Name1];[Name2];[Question Template]
